                            O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made
                            you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺
                            know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah
                            is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware.

                        <p className="animate" >
                            My name is <b>Fadlul Azmi</b>.
                            <br/>
                            I am an allround <b>software engineer</b>. I am a programmer with good knowledge 
                            of web <b>front-end</b> techniques. I love structure and order and I also stand for 
                            quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web 
                            apps. Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more. 
                            As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.

                                I'm graduated from Geophysics major, and had several experiences in <b>Geoscience </b> 
                                Field. Then, I switched my career to <b>Software Development</b>. 
                                So the question is <b>"WHY?"</b>, Because, I want to keep growing, upgrade my skills, 
                                and easily to direct practicing while learning.
